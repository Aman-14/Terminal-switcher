# Terminal Swither

This is a extension that i made for myself for changing my default terminal profile in vscode

## What does it do?

To run my cpp projects i use Code Runner extension, but the problem is that it doesn't work as intended in Git Bash that i use as my default terminal in vscode. So i made a this extension that changes my default terminal to Powershell whenever i open a cpp project.\
That's it.

## Note

This extension will only work in my local PC, if you also want it you can insert your `settings.json` path in `extension.ts` file.
